## Comparing pandemic waves in US and MX (Spanish)

This report of May 2021 compares the COVID waves in the United States and Mexico since the beginning.
I wanted to see if my (informal) observation that the Mexican and American waves had been similar, and
to what extent. I did it at two levels: national, and NYC vs Mexico City.

I made an effort to make the time series correspond in terms of dates and number of deaths 
(which in turn correlate approximately to date of contagion). The waves
turned out to be reasonably synchronized, with the noticeable exception on NYC's massive first wave, at
the beginning of the global epidemic.

Accurately computing deaths in turn required a careful revision of Mexican official figures
to reach a better estimate than the official (and the Mexican authorities have been
changing their estimates since then, revising down the deaths' estimate). So, an important
side result of this report is an actual, honest estimate of deaths due to COVID up to May 2022.

I also estimated the number of deaths that would have occurred in Mexico if the authorities here had been
as competent (or incompetent, if one prefers) in handling the epidemic as in the US. That number is more
conjectural, but we are still in the hundreds of thousands of extra deaths due to the incompetence of the
Mexican government.

From that calculation it became also clear that letality of succesive waves diminished.

## Code

Three interrelated Java programs, no packages involved. Main should be run `%java US_vs_MX 220507`.
Two csv files output to running directory. In all cases, paths in code should point to the correct
directories both for input and output.

There is also some lines of code in R to plot the tables.


## Data

The files involved in the calculus come from the Mexican registry and those from the state of New York.
They are contained in [the zipped directory](./zip.rar).
The only file not included is the COVID daily report from Mexico's Secretar√≠a de Salud.
A file from around the day the calculations were run, 24 may 2022 (i.e. `220524COVID19MEXICO`, 2.4 GB) 
should give the same results. 

Also included: the csv files that are plotted in the report.


## Status

Report is finished.
